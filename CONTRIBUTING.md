## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested.
4. Ensure the test suite passes by running `yarn test`.
5. Update related [documents](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/docs) with details of changes to the interface.
6. Update related [examples](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/examples) if needed.
7. Make sure your code lints by running `yarn lint`.
8. Run `yarn changeset` to [add a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md).

## Development Workflow

You can test new features or debug an issue by the way that I'm using.

1. Run `yarn link-pkg` to link the package into the [app directory](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/app).
2. Run `yarn start` to create `ESM` builds and type definition file by `rollup` watch mode.
3. Access the [app directory](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/app).
4. In the **app directory**, run `yarn link-pkg` to link with the package then run `yarn start:dev` to start development.
5. Try something cool via the [Playground](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/app/src/Playground).

## Useful Commands

There're several useful commands that you can use during the development:

- `yarn link-pkg` links the package into the [app directory](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/app). You can develop or debug it via the [Playground](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-form/tree/master/app/src/Playground).
- `yarn start` creates a `dist` folder with `ESM` builds and type definition file by `rollup` watch mode. You can test the package locally via `yarn link-pkg` or [yarn link](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link).
- `yarn build` creates a `dist` folder with package builds (`CJS`, `ESM`, and `UMD`) and type definition file. You can test the package locally via `yarn link-pkg` or [yarn link](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link).
- `yarn changeset` [adds a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md).
- `yarn lint:code` lints all `.js` and `.tsx?` files.
- `yarn lint:type` runs the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) type-checks.
- `yarn lint:format` formats all files except the file list of `.prettierignore`.
- `yarn lint` lints `code`, `type`, and `format`.
- `yarn test` runs the complete test suite.
- `yarn test:watch` runs an interactive test watcher (helpful in development).
- `yarn test:cov` runs the complete test suite with coverage report.
- `yarn size` checks the bundle size of each format.
- `yarn clean:build` deletes the `dist` build folder.
- `yarn clean:size`: deletes the `.size-snapshot.json` file.
- `yarn clean:cov` deletes the `coverage` report folder.
- `yarn clean` deletes the build, coverage, and size snapshot.

## Style Guide

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org), [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code style and formatting. Run `yarn lint` after making any changes to the code. Then, our linter will catch most issues that might exist in your code.

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about something, looking at [Airbnb’s Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right direction.
